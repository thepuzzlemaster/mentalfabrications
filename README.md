# About this site

A personal portfolio site, built to showcase some of my past work.
Built using [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

This site is meant to convey a professional, yet playful attitude.
It was a fun excuse to explore a new-to-me (at the time) framework (svelte), and a good excuse to play around with creating a playful particle system.
All the physics of the particle system were coded from scratch without relying on any existing drawing or physics libraries.
